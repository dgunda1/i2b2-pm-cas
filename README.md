## What does it do?
This is a stock i2b2 1.7.05 project management module patched with support for delegating authentication to Eureka via its patched [JASIG CAS](http://jasig.github.io/cas/4.1.x/index.html) server module, found at https://github.com/eurekaclinical/cas. JASIG CAS is a single sign-on system. This allows users of Eureka and i2b2 to login once and have access to both systems.

The code is adapted from similar code for an older version of i2b2 by Dan Connolly found at https://bitbucket.org/DanC/i2b2-pm-cas.

## Version history
### Version 1.0
Initial release.

## CAS implementations supported
We expect any full implementation of version 2 of the CAS protocol to work. In particular, the implementation must support proxying. The following implementations of CAS are known to work:
* [Eureka! Clinical CAS](https://github.com/eurekaclinical/cas), which is a patched version of [JASIG CAS version 3.5.2](https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CASUM/Home)
* [Shibboleth Identity Provider version 3](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/IDP30/Home) with CAS emulation turned on

## Requirements
See the [i2b2 installation guide](https://www.i2b2.org/software/files/PDF/current/FR_Installation_Guide.pdf) for requirements. Our patches do not change them.

In order to login to i2b2 using CAS, you also need to install our patched i2b2 webclient, found at https://github.com/eurekaclinical/i2b2-webclient-cas.

## Installation
Follow the usual [i2b2 installation instructions](https://www.i2b2.org/software/files/PDF/current/FR_Installation_Guide.pdf), except replace the stock project management cell with this one before compiling i2b2.

If you are installing i2b2 on a separate machine from Eureka!, create a file, `/etc/eureka/application.properties` with one line: 
`cas.url=URL to your cas server`. This file already exists if you have already installed Eureka on the same machine.

Finally, you may need to install the SSL certificate served by CAS server into the cacerts file of the Java installation that i2b2 is using. This is especially true if the CAS server's certificate is self-signed.

## Configuration
When using these patches, the i2b2 project management module's user data table becomes an authorization table. The code authenticates the user with Eureka! CAS, and then it checks the user data table for the existence of the user's account before authorizing the user. Any passwords in the user data table are ignored. When authorizing users, we strongly recommend that you populate the password field with a random password.

## Licensing
This code is released under the i2b2 Software License version 2.1, available at https://www.i2b2.org/software/i2b2_license.html.
